# wp_blueprints

The idea is not to do another Worpress Theme or another bare WordPress Theme Shell to start coding.
The idea is to test and propose several standard blueprints (multiple types of headers, footers, articles, or else ...)
that can be easily chosen, improved, and switched.

## Build your own base

It is just a start though, but I want this theme to allow developpers to build their own WordPress Theme Base and reuse it through
multiple and different projects. Let's give this project a try !

## What do I need before starting ?

To make it work perfectly you'll need at least 2 or 3 things :

1. A (stable) release of Wordpress ( version >= 4.8 ) that you may download here : https://wordpress.org/download/
2. Some tea (optional) 
3. NodeJS and NPM installed and ready
4. Eventually gulp installed globally or locally ( `npm i -g gulp` or `npm i -D gulp` )

## How to start

When the master branch will be up (I might be currently working on the develop one) : 

1. Clone it (Duh !)
2. Get yourself a cup of tea (optional)
3. Then `cd` to your cloned project folder
4. Type `npm i` and press enter 
5. If you want to do some postCSS or some JS open another terminal, `cd` to your project and just run `gulp` (it has been set to *watch* by default)
6. You are good to go :p
